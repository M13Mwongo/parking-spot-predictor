![pexels-kelly-2402235.jpg](attachment:pexels-kelly-2402235.jpg)

## <ins>Overview</ins>
This repository contains a Time series project focused on predicting parking lot occupancy. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the availability of a parking spot in various parking facilities in the city at a given day and time, helping users plan their parking in advance.

## <ins>Business Understanding</ins>
Finding a parking place in the busy urban environments of major cities throughout the world is a problem that worries locals, commuters, and tourists equally. The need for effective parking solutions is greater than ever due to the fast urbanization, rising traffic, and expanding population. Our initiative is to change parking management in metropolitan areas confronting comparable difficulties throughout the globe by utilizing data-driven insights in response to this urgent issue. It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of this endeavor for metropolitan areas. Urban centers are the epicenters of activity, drawing millions of people for business, pleasure, and employment because they are social, cultural, and economic magnets. Nonetheless, these cities' disorganized traffic and inadequate parking facilities provide serious difficulties for local government, companies, and citizens. Our initiative intends to improve urban mobility by reducing travel times, relieving traffic congestion, and offering accurate estimates of parking spot availability.


### Problem Statement
The absence of accurate and up-to-date data on parking spot availability not only impedes the development of effective predictive models but also limits the implementation of innovative solutions aimed at addressing urban mobility challenges. Without access to comprehensive data sources, parking prediction systems struggle to provide reliable real-time information, leading to suboptimal parking decisions and increased traffic congestion. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for creating a parking prediction system that not only improves parking navigation but also contributes to the overall sustainability and livability of urban areas by enhancing economic productivity, and fostering a more seamless urban mobility experience for all stakeholders.

### Objectives

#### a) Main Objectives
To develop a robust time series-based parking spot predictor that accurately forecasts parking spot availability in urban areas, leveraging historical parking data and real-time variables.
#### b) Specific Objective
To collect and preprocess historical and real-time parking data from various sources and integrate relevant time-varying features, such as time of day, day of the week, and holidays into the data.
To understand the distribution of both numerical columns (capacity, occupancy) and categorical columns (is_holiday) in our data.
To analyze the monthly and daily average occupancy and average parking availability across all parking facilities, identifying patterns and trends over time.
To investigate the impact of holidays and time on parking availability, examining how these factors influence parking spot occupancy and demand.
To explore various time series forecasting techniques, including ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet and evaluate the performance of each technique using metrics like MAE, MSE and RMSE.
To develop and deploy a user-friendly interface that allows motorists to access real-time parking predictions and navigate to available parking spots efficiently.
