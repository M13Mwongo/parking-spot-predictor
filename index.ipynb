    "Data was sourced over a 3 month period, from the beginning of October 2023 to 31st December 2023. A loop was created for each facility using the given date range, and the `get_carpark_history` function was run within that loop. The respective files that were saved contained the parking history of that facility for the 3-month time period (found in *./data/carpark_history_3_months/facility_<<facility_id>>*). However, in a bid to simplify the starting point and to ensure that one dataframe is used as our starting point, the code below was implemented to read all the data from the various JSON files and put it in one file, from which the one dataframe was created."
