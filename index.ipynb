    "Traffic is a nightmare, am I right? You canâ€™t drive anywhere without being stuck in traffic for a while, especially in Nairobi. What makes it worse is that a lot of times during high-traffic periods, such as the mornings and evenings, there is a high likelihood of missing out on your desired parking spot that is near your office, especially when looking at county-run parking.\n",
    "This application hopes to predict the parking patterns and likelihood of having available parking spots in certain areas at a given time of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data analytics and machine learning techniques, we explore the field of **parking prediction** and **urban mobility**. Our research develops a state-of-the-art algorithm that can effectively estimate parking spot availability in metropolitan locations by utilizing real-time parking occupancy data from several sources inclusive of historical records. We welcome you to journey with us as we explore the inner workings of our prediction model, emphasize significant discoveries, and demonstrate how it may revolutionize urban parking system optimization.\n"

    "Finding a parking place in the busy urban environments of major cities throughout the world is a problem that worries locals, commuters, and tourists equally. The need for effective parking solutions is greater than ever due to the fast urbanization, rising traffic, and expanding population. Our initiative is to change parking management in metropolitan areas confronting comparable difficulties throughout the globe by utilizing data-driven insights in response to this urgent issue. It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of this endeavor for metropolitan areas. Urban centers are the epicenters of activity, drawing millions of people for business, pleasure, and employment because they are social, cultural, and economic magnets. Nonetheless, these cities' disorganized traffic and inadequate parking facilities provide serious difficulties for local government, companies, and citizens. Our initiative intends to improve urban mobility by reducing travel times, relieving traffic congestion, and offering accurate estimates of parking spot availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges lies in accessing reliable data on parking occupancy and usage patterns. Parking spaces in urban areas are often managed by various entities, including public agencies, private operators, and informal attendants, making data collection a complex and fragmented process. Moreover, concerns about data privacy and security have hindered efforts to gather comprehensive parking data, as authorities are cautious about disclosing sensitive information due to security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, our project aims to collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **City authorities**: Vital for regulatory support, infrastructure planning, and policy implementation to enhance urban mobility and parking management.\n",
    "- **Parking operators**: Key players responsible for managing parking facilities, providing valuable data, and implementing innovative solutions to optimize parking spot utilization.\n",
    "- **Technology partners**: Essential for developing and implementing data-driven tools, such as predictive models and smart parking systems, to improve parking availability and streamline operations.\n",
    "- **Motorists (end-users)**: The primary beneficiaries of improved parking management solutions, as they will benefit from reduced search time, enhanced convenience, and better access to parking spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "By fostering partnerships and promoting transparency, we seek to establish a data-sharing framework that respects privacy concerns while enabling the development of innovative solutions to improve parking management in urban centers worldwide. Optimizing parking and reducing congestion, enhances business efficiency, attracts investments, and stimulates economic activity. Encouraging alternative transportation modes reduces emissions and contributes to environmental conservation. Through data analytics, stakeholder collaboration, and innovative tech, we aim to create smarter, more efficient urban mobility ecosystems benefiting all."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The absence of accurate and up-to-date data on parking spot availability not only impedes the development of effective predictive models but also limits the implementation of innovative solutions aimed at addressing urban mobility challenges. Without access to comprehensive data sources, parking prediction systems struggle to provide reliable real-time information, leading to suboptimal parking decisions and increased traffic congestion. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for creating a parking prediction system that not only improves parking navigation but also contributes to the overall sustainability and livability of urban areas by enhancing economic productivity, and fostering a more seamless urban mobility experience for all stakeholders."

This decision helps to prevent valuable information from being discarded, which could potentially skew subsequent analyses or models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, retaining outliers guards against bias being introduced into the analysis, as extreme values may represent genuine data points rather than errors. Additionally, the presence of outliers contributes to the robustness of analysis, as it ensures that statistical methods and machine learning algorithms are not unduly influenced by extreme values. Moreover, outliers can provide insights into unique patterns or anomalies within the data, prompting further investigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, analyzing outliers aids in identifying data quality issues such as measurement errors or data entry mistakes, facilitating improvements in data collection processes and overall data quality. Thus, while the decision to keep or remove outliers depends on the specific context and objectives of the analysis, retaining outliers is often essential for ensuring accurate and comprehensive data analysis."

    "1. **Original Component**:\n",
    "   - The **original component** represents the **raw data** without any adjustments. In this case, it appears to be a dataset that varies over time.\n",
    "   - Looking at the graph, we notice several oscillations (ups and downs) along with an overall declining trend. These fluctuations could be due to various factors, such as seasonality, external events, or underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trend Component**:\n",
    "   - The **trend component** is obtained by **smoothing out** the original data to reveal the **long-term behavior** or direction.\n",
    "   - In your graph, the trend shows a **gradual decline** over the observed period (from July 2023 to January 2024). This decline might indicate a consistent downward movement in the underlying phenomenon being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonality Component**:\n",
    "   - The **seasonality component** captures **recurring patterns** that occur at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly).\n",
    "   - From the graph, we can see periodic peaks and valleys. These could correspond to seasonal effects, such as monthly fluctuations, holidays, or other cyclic events.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Residuals Component**:\n",
    "   - The **residuals component** represents the **unexplained variations** in the data after removing the trend and seasonality.\n",
    "   - These residuals are essentially the **noise** or irregularities left behind. They could result from random fluctuations, measurement errors, or other factors not accounted for by the trend and seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "- The declining trend suggests that there might be an underlying reason for the overall decrease in the observed phenomenon.\n",
    "- Seasonality could provide insights into recurring patterns. For example, if this data represents sales, the peaks might coincide with holiday seasons.\n",
